    \begin{itemize}
    \item When you are satisfied with your figures, run the command \\
      \texttt{scons lock} \\
      to transfer all your results in the figure archive. This is
      necessary in order to build your document. 
    \item Change to \texttt{$\sim$/gpgn302/\thisdoc}) and build the lab paper:\\
      \texttt{scons read} \\
      If everything works well, a PDF reader should pop-up on screen
      with your document. Please remove from the paper file all the
      instructions (e.g. this section) and leave only the questions,
      your answers and the figures (i.e. the \texttt{assignment} section).
    \item Upload the file \texttt{paper.pdf} to Blackboard for grading.
    \item Clean-up all temporary files by running the command \\
      \texttt{scons -c} \\
      in the paper directory, as well as in all the example directories.
    \end{itemize}
